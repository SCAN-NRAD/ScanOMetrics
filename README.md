# ScanOMetrics

Welcome to the ScanOMetrics repository !

About
=====
ScanOMetrics is an open-source software for normative modeling from MRI scans. Our tool currently provides a GUI for basic MRI
processing, statistical evaluation against a reference population, and visualization of results with 3D surface rendering as well
as detailed cloudpoints and metric spyder plots.
